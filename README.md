# Eat-Da-Burger-ORM

This application utilizes the MySQL database and ORMs to allow users to create their own burger and then "devour" it. The application pushes the newly created burger to the left side of the page until it gets devoured in which case it is moved to the right side of the page.

The code efficientcy isn't particularly great as the project was designed specifically to demonstrate ORMs and how to utilize them passing information from the front in to the database and back again.
